      <h1>The GREATEST of ALL TIMES</h1>
      <p class="biography">
        More than any other sportsman in history, Muhammad Ali transcended his
        sport to reach out to people as a role model and hero. As Cassius Clay,
        Ali travelled to the 1960 Rome Games to compete in the light heavyweight
        division. Despite being only 18, he won all four of his fights easily.
        In the final he defeated three-time European champion Zbigniew
        Pietrzykowski to win the gold medal. Clay turned professional and won
        the heavyweight World Championship for the first time in 1964, beating
        Sonny Liston in a legendary fight. Over the next four years he defended
        his title nine times, converted to Islam and changed his name to
        Muhammad Ali. However, he was stripped of his title in 1967, when he
        refused to be drafted into the US army, citing religious and personal
        beliefs. He did not fight again for three and a half years. Ali regained
        his title in 1974 by knocking out George Foreman in a fight staged in
        the present-day Democratic Republic of Congo, (formerly Zaire) known as
        “the Rumble in the Jungle”. In 1975 he beat Joe Frazier in “the Thriller
        in Manila”. He eventually retired from boxing in 1981 with a
        professional record of 56 wins and 5 losses. In 1996, Ali was chosen to
        light the flame during the Opening Ceremony of the Atlanta Olympic
        Games. He has devoted much of his life to humanitarian affairs. In 1998
        Ali was honoured with the United Nations Messenger of Peace award.

    <section class="quotes">
        <p>“I’m not the greatest; I’m the double greatest. Not only do I knock ’em out, I pick the round. “</p>
          <p>  “I ain’t got no quarrel with those Vietcong” and “no Vietcong ever called me nigger.” </p> 
        <p>“Cassius Clay is a slave name. I didn’t choose it and I don’t want it. I am Muhammad Ali, a free name – it means beloved of God – and I insist people use it when people speak to me and of me.”</p>
        <p>“Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs?</p>
        <p>“Floats like a butterfly, sting like a bee, his hands can’t hit what his eyes can’t see.”</p>
        <p>“Maybe my Parkinson’s is God’s way of reminding me what is important. It slowed me down and caused me to listen rather than talk. Actually, people pay more attention to me now because I don’t talk as much.”</p>
        <p>“Since he retired from boxing, Ali has devoted himself to humanitarian endeavours around the globe. He is a devout Sunni Muslim, and travels the world over, lending his name and presence to hunger and poverty relief, supporting education efforts of all kinds, promoting adoption and encouraging people to respect and better understand one another. It is estimated that he has helped to provide more than 22 million meals to feed the hungry. Ali travels, on average, more than 200 days per year.”</p>
        <p>“Will they ever have another fighter who writes poems, predicts rounds, beats everybody, makes people laugh, makes people cry and is as tall and extra pretty as me?”</p>
